# Information for Presentation and Final Submission

## Presentation Video

All papers (full and short) get 20 minutes for the talk and then 10 minutes
for questions and switching presenters. We have a full schedule this year â€“ 
please stay on time.

LDAV 2020 is held in a virtual format using video presentations. 
Please read thoroughly technical information for recording your talk 
from the [IEEE VIS speaker information]. (Note that LDAV has a different 
slide template and talk length than the main VIS conference.)

All presenters are encouraged to use the [LDAV slide template]. 
To gain maximum size and benefit on the screen, we suggest presenters 
use the 16x9 wide PowerPoint format, given the resolution 
of your presentation video must be 1920x1080, as indicated in the 
[IEEE VIS speaker information]. 

Unlike the main VIS conference, LDAV paper authors do not need to prepare 
the preview or fast-forward video. 

## Final Submission

This year, there have been significant changes in the final paper submission 
process for IEEE VIS and associated events, including LDAV. 

All final submission items need to be submitted to LDAV 2020 Author Submission Site 
on IEEE CPS (login required). The items include:
* Final camera-ready PDF
* Electronic Copyright
* Optional supplemental file(s)
* Presentation video
* Preview image with caption
* Subtitle file

Optionally, you can submit the following items:
* Appendix PDF
* Supplementary video
* Readme file (required if you submit the supplementary video)

It is imperative authors have their assigned Paper ID to ensure all submissions can be tracked.

Once sign up (if you do not have an account) and login, the site provides detailed guidance for all items, including the specifications 
on paper, presentation video, preview image, subtitle file, and supplemental file(s), 
the instruction on video and image submission, and paper formatting. Note that 
* Paper, copyright, and optional supplemental file(s) submissions are due <br />**September 7, 2020 @ 11:59 pm AoE**.
* Presentation video, preview image with caption, and subtitle file submissions are due <br />**September 14, 2020 @ 11:59 pm AoE**.

LDAV assigned CPS Editor, Lisa O'Conner (loconner@computer.org), will assist authors as needed. 
Please email Lisa should you have questions or encounter problems in your CPS submission.
